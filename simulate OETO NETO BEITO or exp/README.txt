params - stores the parameters used on exponential and full simulations
sample_new_pl_zeros - Stores the time for which new pole does not grow because the HADA label accumulation
is not observed (Column 1). Column 2 stores the bias in calculating the initial HADA label observed 
sample_time_from_here - Stores the take off times of the old pole (Column 1) and new pole (Column 2)
for non BEITO cells
